# Session metadata

`scripts/session-metadata.py --codex-index` requires an explicit `session_index.jsonl`
and canonical source session UUID, and supplies names only. Linux and Darwin open
each path component relative to its parent descriptor without following symlinks;
Darwin's exact root `/var` and `/tmp` system aliases are supported. Custom symlinks,
private-store components and unsupported platforms are refused. The opened file
must be regular and at most 64 KiB; content reads remain bounded if it grows.
Fixture mode retains its stricter private-directory exclusions. Unmanaged capture
remains unavailable until the exact owning source is bound; live model and effort
capture remain unimplemented.
